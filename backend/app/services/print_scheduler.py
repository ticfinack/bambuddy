# byte gate) from before the scheduler unification. Time gate keeps small
# files from going silent (a single 8 KB chunk fires once and that's it);
# byte gate caps the broadcast rate on slow LAN where 200 ms covers many
# chunks. uploaded >= total always emits so the bar closes cleanly even on
# sub-200 ms files.

    ``upload_file_async`` runs the FTP transfer in an executor thread and

    body cannot ``await`` directly. This bridge captures the asyncio loop
    at construction (on the scheduler thread) and uses
    ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` to hop back. The byte/time throttle
    matches the legacy background_dispatch.py path 1:1 so the toast feels
    identical to the pre-#1625 experience.

    Failures inside the emit are swallowed — progress is a UX nicety, the
    upload itself must not fail because of a WS hiccup.

        Dispatch used to happen inline in the selection loop: ``await
        _start_print(db, item)`` per item in turn. Since ``_start_print``
        performs the FTP upload, that serialized every printer behind every
        other printer's transfer even though the printers are independent
        machines; #2555 moved it to a parallel ``asyncio.gather()``. But that
        gather was awaited before ``check_queue`` returned, so the run loop
        stayed blocked until the *slowest* upload in the batch finished — a
        513 s upload left 15 of 16 configured slots idle for 8.5 minutes on a
        93-printer farm even as other printers came free (#2602).

        Each upload now runs as an independent background task tracked in
        ``self._inflight``. check_queue excludes in-flight item_ids (still
        `pending` until their upload completes) and their printers from the
        next pass's selection, and this method launches at most
        ``limit - len(self._inflight)`` new uploads, so a freed slot refills on
        the next fast tick instead of waiting out the whole batch. The bound
        exists because the printers are independent but the host is not: each
        in-flight upload holds a thread in the FTP pool, a TLS session and a
        file handle.

        The no-overlapping-dispatch invariant the batch-await used to provide

        The MQTT ``remain`` field on a tray is the printer firmware's
        RFID-decremented value, which has two limitations the "Prefer Lowest
        Remaining Filament" feature has been ignoring (#1508):

        - it's only meaningful for Bambu RFID spools; everything else reports
          ``-1`` (then clamped to a sentinel), so multiple non-RFID trays
          compare equal and the sort collapses to AMS-slot order — the user
          who's curating inventory weights gets the lower-slot pick instead
          of the lower-remaining pick;
        - even when set, it's the *printer's* counter, not Bambuddy's
          ``label_weight - weight_used`` (internal mode) or Spoolman's
          ``remaining_weight`` (Spoolman mode) — the two diverge any time the
          user re-spools, swaps cardboard, or runs a print outside Bambuddy.

        When the user has bound a spool to a slot, their own inventory
        tracking is authoritative; this helper surfaces that value so the
        sort can prefer it. Slots without a binding are absent from the
        returned map — the caller then falls back to MQTT ``remain`` for
        those, preserving the pre-#1508 behaviour for un-tracked spools.

        Returns an empty map on any failure (no inventory bindings, DB
        error, Spoolman unreachable). A best-effort lookup; "Prefer Lowest"
        is a preference, not a guarantee.

               sensor to rise via bed radiation OR fall through on timeout.
             - No chamber sensor (P1S/P1P/A1/A1 Mini): no way to verify chamber
               temperature; the function just heats the bed and holds for the
               configured soak duration.

        Bambuddy optimistically marks the queue item as "printing" right after the
        MQTT project_file publish succeeds locally. The watchdog runs in two phases:

        Phase A (up to ``timeout``): wait for either an active-state transition
        or a ``subtask_id`` advance past ``pre_subtask_id``. State alone is the
        primary signal; subtask_id advance handles the H2D case where state can
        sit at FINISH for ~50 s after the printer accepted ``project_file``
        before flipping to PREPARE (#1078). If neither happens, the MQTT publish
        was lost on a half-broken session (#887/#936) — revert and force
        reconnect (the #967 recovery path).

        Phase B (up to ``phase_b_timeout``, only if Phase A exited on subtask_id
        alone): keep watching for the active-state transition. subtask_id alone
        proves the file landed but not that the printer started — and a printer
        that accepts the command but stays at IDLE/FINISH indefinitely (e.g.
        cloud+LAN re-auth dance after a power cycle on old firmware, #1678)
        used to leave the queue item stuck in 'printing' forever because the
        old watchdog returned success as soon as subtask_id advanced. If Phase
        B times out, revert the queue item so the user can retry without
        restarting Bambuddy. Skip ``force_reconnect`` here: the file landed and
        a forced reconnect mid-parse triggers 0500_4003 (#1150).

        Phase A timeout raised from 45 s → 90 s as belt-and-braces for slow
        transitions that also don't emit an early subtask_id tick.
